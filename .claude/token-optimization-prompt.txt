# Token Optimization Prompt for Claude Code
# Copy and paste this ONCE at the start of your session with: claude --dangerously-skip-permissions

===========================================
CRITICAL TOKEN OPTIMIZATION RULES - FOLLOW STRICTLY:

1. NEVER read, search, grep, or access these directories:
   - node_modules/ (use package.json instead)
   - .git/ (use git commands only)
   - dist/, build/, .next/, .nuxt/ (build artifacts)
   - __pycache__/, *.pyc (Python cache)
   - .env files (unless explicitly requested)

2. ALWAYS use targeted searches:
   ✅ grep "pattern" src/
   ✅ find src/ -name "*.ts"
   ✅ ls src/components/

   ❌ grep -r "pattern" .
   ❌ find . -name "*.ts"
   ❌ cat node_modules/package/file.js

3. Before ANY project-wide search, ask me first

4. When exploring code:
   - Start with src/ directory only
   - Read specific files, not entire directories
   - Use glob patterns to understand scope first

5. For dependencies:
   - Check package.json
   - Never read files inside node_modules/

WHY: Following these rules saves 70-85% of context window tokens, prevents rate limits, and keeps sessions fast.

Now ready for your request.
